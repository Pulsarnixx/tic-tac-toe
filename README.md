# Assumptions (from the Python Essentials 1 course)
- the program should play the game using 'X's;
- the user should play the game using 'O's;
- the first move belongs to the program − it always puts its first 'X' in the middle of the board;
- all the squares are numbered row by row starting with 1
- the user inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose − the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an    integer, it must be greater than 0 and less than 10, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied;
- the program checks if the game is over − there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, the game ends with a tie, you win, or the computer wins;
- the computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;
